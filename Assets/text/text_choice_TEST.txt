[[Twine Oddities|<\BUBBLE>BadTwineSection]]
//
<\BUBBLE>TeachItalic
Text can be italicized when an asterisk (\*) is used in a sentence. use \* again to stop the italicizing.
Italicizing will automagically be turned off once a new line is started.
[[Return|<\BUBBLE>DialogSection]]
//
<\BUBBLE>TeachUnderLine
Text can be underlined when an underscore (\_) is used in a sentence. use \_ again to stop the underline.
Underlines will automagically be turned off once a new line is started.
[[Return|<\BUBBLE>DialogSection]]
//
<\BUBBLE>TeachStrikeThrough
Text can have a strikethrough when an tilde (\~) is used in a sentence. use \~ again to stop the strikethrough.
Strikethroughs will automagically be turned off once a new line is started.
[[Return|<\BUBBLE>DialogSection]]
//
<\BUBBLE>TeachTextSpeed
The rate that the text can appear at can be sped up or slowed down using \<speed=[seconds]>, where [seconds] can be any floating point number.
Text speed will NOT be changed when a new line is started.
Example: <speed=0.25>this text will fill in slowly!<speed=0.0> Now it fills in super quickly!
[[Return|<\BUBBLE>TimeSection]]
//
<\BUBBLE>TeachTextPause
The text that appears can be paused using \<pause=[seconds]>, where [seconds] can be any floating point number.
Example: this text will be paused<pause=2.5> for two and a half seconds!
[[Return|<\BUBBLE>TimeSection]]
//
<\BUBBLE>TeachChangeName
the name that displays in the text box can be changed using \<name=[name]>, where [name] is the name of the character you want to use.
it is best to use it at the start of a sentence. Otherwise the name textbox will update mid-sentence.
<name=You>Example: I can put words in your mouth!
[[Return|<\BUBBLE>DialogSection]]
//
<\BUBBLE>TeachChoice
A choice can be given to the player by using \<choice>, and then inserting two or more links to other passages directly below \<choice>.
you must also set these choices to have human-readable names. you can do this the same as you would in Twine (like this: -->\[[Return|<\BUBBLE>START]]).
Example: do you understand how to create choices? <choice>
[[Yes!|<\BUBBLE>SpecialCharSection]]
[[No...|<\BUBBLE>TeachChoice]]
//
<\BUBBLE>TeachExitCharacter
an exit character (\\) can be used to write special characters such as these (\* \@ \_ \~ \\) without causing any effects to happen
Example: using \\\_ will not make underline the text, but not using the exit character _will make the text underlined.
[[Return|<\BUBBLE>SpecialCharSection]]
//
<\BUBBLE>TeachComments
similar to commenting out code in C#, text can be commented out using two slashes (//), but ONLY at the beginning of the line! (othwise it won't work)
comments are useful as it can add spacing between passages if you're reading it from the proofing copy.
[[Return|<\BUBBLE>SpecialCharSection]]
//
<\BUBBLE>TeachBold
Text can be bolded when an atsign (\@) is used in a sentence. use \@ again to stop the bolding.
Bolding will automagically be turned off once a new line is started.
[[Return|<\BUBBLE>DialogSection]]
//
<\BUBBLE>TeachPassage
While a passage can be created normally in Twine, it needs to have <\BUBBLE> preceeding the passage's name so that Unity can search for it easily.
(yes it's named BUBBLE and not PASSAGE, I didnt bother changing it b/c I fugured it'd be easier just to tell you than change 57 lines of code to now say PASSAGE)
...just know that bubbles are the same as passages.

//
<\BUBBLE>TeachPreventNL
Twine will automatically create a new line when text overflows onto the next line (pushing the text both visibly and literally onto the next line).
This can be solved by rescaling the "printout".

<\BUBBLE>TeachCopyHeading
When copying text from the proofing copy, the headings of each bubble/passage will not copy along with it.
This can be solved by fake printing it, as both the text and the headings in the viewing box can be selected!
